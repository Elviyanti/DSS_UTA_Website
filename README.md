# DSS_UTA_Website
This project is a Decision Support System (DSS) built with Laravel 12, implementing the UTA (UTilit√©s Additives) method to rank and recommend alternatives based on multiple criteria. The application allows users to input alternatives and criteria, compute rankings using the UTA method, and export the result as a downloadable PDF.
